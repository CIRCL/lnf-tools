nfdump-toptalkers -s <ip address>

Use a nfdump output as input (long format) and extract the top talkers related
to an address. The data is read from standard input. The top talkers are
classified with the exchanged volume. A list is displayed on standard output.

OPTIONS

    -h Displays this screen
    -s Specify the IP address

EXAMPLE

    nfdump-toptalkers -s 10.0.0.1

OUTPUT

    #Rank Hostname numberofbytes

    1 10.10.10.1 200000
    2 10.10.10.2 120000
    3 10.11.10.1 99810
    4 10.11.11.2 11192


The first column displays the rank, the second column displays the IP address
and the last column shows the number of exchanged bytes.
